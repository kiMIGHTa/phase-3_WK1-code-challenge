# Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

- This function takes in three parameters i.e hour, minute and period
- The function works by operating on the hour and minute integers according to condition determined by the period string
- The function then converts those integers into strings using the str() method and .zfill() which converts it to a two digit string. Note that it adds a zero before the string if it is a single digit integer. i.e 5 will become '05'.
- The result string are then concantenated.

## Operation
- Run python lib/challenge_1.py in your terminal while in the phase-3_WK1-code-challenge dir.
